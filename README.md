# GtDrawExample

Example Showcasing a Proof of Concept for Line Drawing Functionality on top of [Glamorous Toolkit](https://gtoolkit.com/).

# Installation

Just inspect the code in the `.st` file in this repo in a playground in gtoolkit. This doesn't even create new classes to enable this functionality, so there is nothing to install.

# Usage

After inspecting the code, draw away on the `BlElement` created by dragging (clicking + moving mouse) or using another input device.

This is an MVP/POC meant to inspire others to build interesting UI/UX interactions on top of gtoolkit. This is not a finished application, has no 'features' and probably won't get any additional work done, ever. Just leaving code here with a very permissive license to inspire others. Glamorous Toolkit is FULL of interesting examples yet I did not find anything close to free-form line drawing; all the components were there just needed to get some lower-level context on the window rendering back-ends and connect the dots. Happy drawing!
